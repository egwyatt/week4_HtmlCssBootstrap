<div class="myjh"> <p2>Jimi Hendrix grew up in Seattle, Washington. From an early age he expressed interest in guitar.In fact he carries a stick around with him which he would pretend to play as a guitatr. A teacher at his school tried to get resources to but Jimi a guitar worrying that the denial of such an outlet would result in psychiological damage to Hendrix. Though the guitar was never granted Jim was able to find an old ukele. And started playing.
